Welcome to my homepage! 

I would like to introduce you to my research focusing on _wearables_, _microfluidics_, _3D printing_, and _printed electronics_. Using these technologies, I have realized several applications with _in vitro diagnostics_, _wearable sensors_, and _point of care diagnostics_.
